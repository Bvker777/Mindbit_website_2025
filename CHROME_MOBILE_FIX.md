# ✅ Chrome Mobile Visibility Fix - Complete

## Problem Identified and Fixed
Content was not loading/displaying on Chrome mobile browser across **5 sections**:
- Hero Section
- Services Section  
- Featured Projects Section
- Why Choose Us Section
- Team Section

## Root Cause
Framer Motion components were initializing with `initial="hidden"` (opacity: 0) on mobile devices but never transitioning to visible state due to conflicting animation configurations.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed 8 Files Total:

#### Core Libraries (2 files)
1. **`src/lib/use-scroll-animation.ts`**
   - Changed `getMotionConfig()` from `initial: false` → `initial: "visible"` on mobile
   - This ensures all components using this function start visible

2. **`src/lib/mobile-animation-utils.ts`**
   - Updated config to use `initial: "visible"` instead of `initial: false`
   - Added explicit visibility CSS rules for mobile

#### Styling (1 file)
3. **`src/app/globals.css`**
   - Added `opacity: 1 !important` for all content on mobile
   - Removed aggressive `transform: none` rules that interfered with rendering

#### Components (5 files)
4. **`src/components/Hero.tsx`**
   - Added mobile checks for parallax transforms
   - Ensured opacity always 1 on mobile

5. **`src/components/Services.tsx`**
   - ServiceCard: Changed to `initial={disableMobileAnimations ? "visible" : "hidden"}`
   - All nested elements start visible on mobile

6. **`src/components/FeaturedProjects.tsx`**
   - ProjectCard: Changed to `initial={disableMobileAnimations ? "visible" : "hidden"}`
   - Disabled parallax on mobile

7. **`src/components/WhyChooseUs.tsx`**
   - FeatureItem: All animations check `disableMobileAnimations`
   - Nested elements (WavePath, title, description) start visible on mobile

8. **`src/components/TeamSection.tsx`**
   - TeamMemberCard: Variants have no animation on mobile
   - All nested elements start visible on mobile

2. Click device toolbar (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M)
3. Select mobile device (iPhone 12 Pro, Pixel 5, etc.)
4. Refresh page

  src/components/Hero.tsx \
  src/components/Services.tsx \
  src/components/FeaturedProjects.tsx \
